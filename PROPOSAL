I will be creating a game on Greenfoot that is underwater themed, with two players who are racing to reach the finish line.
I got my inspiration from Donkey Kong, and the story about the Tortoise and the Hare.. I wanted a game where there are objects would 
destroy the players as they are making their way upwards. There are two players jumping on the platforms to get to the top. Whoever 
reaches the finish line is the winner. However, if you touch one of the bombs your character will be removed. This game is a game of luck 
where the bombs will spawn randomly and they will move in random directions bouncing off the walls. To maneuver the player on the left the
keys to move left is the “e” key. To move right you will press down on the “r” key. To jump for the left player you would press on the “t”
key. The controls for the right player would be “i” for right, “u” for left and “t” to jump.
